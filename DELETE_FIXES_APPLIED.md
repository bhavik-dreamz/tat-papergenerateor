# Delete Operation Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. **Qdrant Delete Errors**
- **Problem**: `deleteCourseMaterial` was failing with connection timeouts when Qdrant was unavailable
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `isQdrantEnabled()` check to skip deletion when disabled
  - Added connection test before attempting deletion
  - Improved error handling with graceful warnings instead of hard failures

### 2. **File Delete Errors** 
- **Problem**: `ENOENT: no such file or directory` when trying to delete files that don't exist
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `existsSync()` check before attempting file deletion
  - Graceful handling when files are already deleted or missing
  - Clear logging of file deletion status

### 3. **Database Delete Errors**
- **Problem**: `P2025` error when trying to delete records that don't exist
- **Solution**: 
  - Added explicit handling for P2025 (record not found) errors
  - Better error messages for already-deleted materials
  - Proper HTTP status codes (404 for not found)

### 4. **General Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Errors in one step were causing entire operation to fail
- **Solution**: 
  - Each deletion step now handles its own errors gracefully
  - Operations continue even if individual steps fail
  - Clear logging of what succeeded/failed
  - User gets success response as long as database deletion succeeds

## Before vs After

### Before:
```
Error deleting from Qdrant: TypeError: fetch failed
Error deleting file: ENOENT: no such file or directory
Error deleting material: Record to delete does not exist
```

### After:
```
ℹ️ Qdrant is disabled - skipping vector database deletion
ℹ️ File not found, may have been deleted already: filename.pdf
✅ Material deleted successfully from database
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Fail-Safe Design**: Each operation is independent - if one fails, others continue
2. **Clear Status Messages**: Users know exactly what happened at each step
3. **Qdrant Awareness**: Respects the `QDRANT_ENABLED` setting
4. **File System Safety**: Checks file existence before deletion attempts
5. **Database Safety**: Handles race conditions and already-deleted records

The delete operation is now robust and will work reliably whether Qdrant is available or not, and whether files exist or have been manually deleted.
